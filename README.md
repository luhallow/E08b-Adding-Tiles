The fun part of these assignments have been seeing the visual representations simultaneously with the code/ program that I'm building. Following along with the instructions and listening along in class helped not only to make sense of all of this a bit more, but also to keep everything running pretty smooth. Implementing the tiles in this assignment was super easy to get the hang of after the first run through, and I felt like I had a handle on the general building of projects in Godot after this assignment.
